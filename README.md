# IMPROVED TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION
An improved two-factor authentication app. Currently, two-factor auth is done through SMS texting or TOTP (Google Auth). With SMS, a hacker can use SIM cloning or spoofing to get the authentication code. With TOTP, a hacker can use fishing attacks. To solve this, we combine the best of SMS and TOTP. In essence, we created a separate app with functionality of Google auth with the ability to communicate to the user the nature of the request so you know what youâ€™re accepting.

## Takaways
* This was made in a team of 5 people of GoDaddy interns. When creating my team, I wanted a diverse group of people, so it was with many people I had not worked with before. This posed a challenge and helped me learn how to work in larger teams with less experience working with each other
* This was the first time I worked in security and RSA encryption.
* As it was a hackathon, this was a great learning experience with dealing with a time crunch.
