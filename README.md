# Improved 2fa

An improved two-factor authentication app. Currently, two factor auth is done through SMS texting or TOTP (Google Auth). With SMS, a hacker can use SIM cloning or spoofing to get the authentication code. With TOTP, a hacker can use fishing attacks. To solve this, we combine the best of SMS and TOTP. In essense, we created a separate app with functionality of Google auth with the ability to communicate to the user the nature of the request so you know what youâ€™re accepting.
